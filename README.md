# WifiBell Configurator

A web UI for Wifi enabled bells configuration.

These bells often use a modified version of Foscam software, and as such, provide a lot more configuration options than exposed by the Wifi doorbell application, via use of cgi scripts.
This web UI exposes these configuration options in a human-friendly manner.

Supported hardware:
- Actop Wifi601
- Actop Wifi602
- Konx Wifi Doorbell
